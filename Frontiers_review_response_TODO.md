## Q3
### Review of Literature:
Review of literature should include more development of the major ideas examined in this study. 
 * opening paragraph is confusing:
   * clearly introduce the two larger concepts of flow conditions and phenomenological flow factors => then the short form of C1 – 3 and F1 – 6 can be used. 
 * conduct a careful edit to address (a) many grammatical errors; (b) awkward sentences (i.e., sentences in lines 31 – 36, 47 – 52, 53 - 60). 
 * more clarity is needed when discussing concepts and terms such as reference level, absolute magnitude, power law model, etc. 
 * elaborate on the power law model of learning. 
 * Lastly, the final two paragraphs seem better suited to the result or discussion sections of the manuscript.

## Q3 / Q4
### Methods
Protocol for physiologic data collecting needs to be outlined in more detail: this protocol may influence subjective flow responses
 * Did the participants have a practice session to adapt to the equipment prior to the eight sessions?
 * did all sessions include the same conditions (baseline seated rest while staring at the screen). 
 * Was there a post rest assessment after the completion of the computer game? 
 * Could physiologic measures alter flow states?
