\begin{abstract}
The state of `optimal experience' called Flow arises during the skilful performance of a demanding task. Flow has been well studied using methods of experimental psychology but has tended to focus on experiential/phenomenal states. Here, we focus in contrast on the cognitive learning process that generates the experience. We present a longitudinal study of learning of a bespoke steering-game task, which induces a near constant state of elevated Flow. Using relatively high-frequency Flow assessments over 40 game trials in eight sessions, we obtain a rich dataset relating performance to Flow, and concurrently measure physiology including eye tracking. We find that the variation in Flow across all trials is less affected by overall performance improvement, than by deviation of performance from the expected value predicted by a power law model of learning. Further, we find that spontaneous blink rate, a non-invasive index of striatal dopamine, relates to the rate of learning; and this relationship is moderated by Flow.

\section*{Introduction}

In many fields of human endeavour - such as music, art and sports - the skilful performance of a demanding task can elicit a state of `optimal experience' called Flow \cite{Csikszentmihalyi1975}. The conditions for Flow are: {\sf C1} task demands match skill at a high level of performance; {\sf C2} clear and personally significant goals; and {\sf C3} unambiguous feedback on goal achievement. When these conditions are met, an individual may enter a mode of high performance characterized by several self-reported features: {\sf F1} total focus in the present moment, and concentration on what one is doing; {\sf F2} merging of action and awareness (being `one' with the task); {\sf F3} loss of reflective self-consciousness or a sense of effortlessness and automaticity; {\sf F4} a sense of personal control and confidence in one's skill; {\sf F5} positive affect, or an experience of the activity as highly enjoyable and intrinsically rewarding; {\sf F6} a distortion of temporal experience (time may seem to go slower or faster than normal) \cite{Nakamura2002,Engeser2012intro,Keller2012}. Flow has an autotelic quality, i.e. people want to do Flow-producing activities for their own sake regardless of external reward.

The antecedent conditions ({\sf C1-3}) and phenomenological features ({\sf F1-6}) of Flow have been investigated for several decades, mainly using analysis of self-report data from participants engaging in natural everyday or expert performance \cite{Csikszentmihalyi1971,Moneta2012}. Understanding in detail how the conditions give rise to the Flow experience, and what the specific mediating mechanisms are, would be significant for enhancing well-being or performance (e.g. through better design of recreational tasks such as games \cite{Chen2007}, or development of coaching practices or concentraton techniques in sport \cite{Jackson1996}). This calls for a more controlled and quantitative approach to studying Flow, using experimental psychology \cite{Harris2017,Keller2008} and psychophysiology \cite{Peifer2012,Peifer2014,Wolf2015,Harmat2015,Labonte-LeMoyne2016} approaches.

%anticipate MAIN RESULT and its IMPLICATIONS here
This paper reports an experimental study on the connections between performance, psychophysiology and the self-reported phenomenology of Flow in a novel and demanding visuomotor task. The task succeeds in eliciting an elevated level of Flow across all reports. Yet when we examine Flow with fine granularity, we see that variation in Flow responses relates less to overall performance improvement, than it does to deviation of performance from the expected value predicted by a power law model of learning. This result implies that Flow dynamics could be better captured by a cognitive model than by the state-like models of the phenomenal psychology tradition \cite{Moneta2012}.


\paragraph{Protocol and Research Questions.}

Participants learned to play a custom-made high-speed steering game (Fig.~\ref{fig:cogcarsim}). The game was specifically designed to elicit Flow through balancing task demand with the skill level of the participant, and providing clear immediate feedback. The aim in the game was to steer through a course with randomly placed obstacles at the highest possible speed. The game always started at a fixed forward velocity which increased at a constant rate. The lateral position of the cube was controlled by the steering wheel (cube position directly corresponded to wheel position). Collision with obstacles reduced speed by a fixed amount, also indicated by a flashing of the screen (see Methods for units).
% Speed, measured in units per time step, started at 1.6 units/step and increased at a constant rate;
This design, inspired by psychophysical staircase methods \cite{Cornsweet1962}, ensured constant match between skill and demand at the participant's level of performance. The performance was measured by duration of the trial (shorter duration = faster average speed = better), displayed as a time score at the end of each run.

\begin{figure*}[!ht]

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Screenshot_cogcarsim}
	\caption{The high-speed steering task. The participant steers the blue cube to avoid ostacles on the track. The game was designed to continually adapt the difficulty level (speed) to the participant's skill (obstacle collisions). Such balance is considered one of the key antecedents of Flow.}
	\label{fig:cogcarsim}
\end{figure*}

Nine participants (6M, 3F) played the game in eight sessions over a period of 2-3 weeks, one session per day, 5 runs per session (i.e. a total of forty runs, each about 2-4 min duration, depending on performance). Based on extensive informal piloting, we judged that the resulting about 2h would be sufficient to achieve good proficiency in this task, but with no ceiling effect. The 10 item Flow Short Scale \cite{Engeser2008} was filled after each run to probe self-reported Flow in the task. Physiological data were recorded, during task and five minutes of baseline, in sessions one and five-to-eight.

This design allowed us to explore the following Research Questions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item RQ1. How does performance change over time, i.e. what is the shape of the `learning curve' (LC)? Specifically, does performance in the game improve, and does improvement follow a power law of practice (as found in much previous work on visuomotor skill acquisition \cite{Newell1982})?

	\item RQ2. How is trial-wise self-reported Flow (from hereon simply `Flow') related to performance? Specifically, is performance improvement across the whole experiment (i.e. learning) accompanied by higher levels of Flow?

	\item RQ3. Are there identifiable physiological markers of Flow and/or physiological measures that are predictive of task performance? Specifically, given its putative association with striatal dopamine\cite{Slagter2012}, spontaneous eye blink rate (sEBR) was of interest in our reinforcement-based learning task (positive reinforcement from increase in speed, negative reinforcement from collisions). Other measures were collected as well, but will be analyzed and reported elsewhere; here we focus on the sEBR Results.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Results}
% We should aim to make results understandable without the detailed methods which will be placed at the end
All participants completed the task (40 runs in total). Average run duration was 186s (SD 18.2s, min 162.2s, max 300.1s). Average number of collisions was 17.8 (SD 4.9, min 5, max 40). Average velocity of runs ranged between 1.37 and 2.54 units per step (mean 2.23, sd 0.19). Maximum instantaneous speed was 3.6 and minimum 1.06. The supplementary information provides comprehensive data on performance-related features, such as run duration, along with correlations between them (Fig.~\ref{fig:scatter_matrix}). For all results, detailed descriptions of statistical methods can be found in Methods section.

\subsection*{RQ1: how does performance change over time?}

What is the form of the learning curve, does it consistently improve e.g. as a power law of practice \cite{Newell1982}? A power-law curve transformed to log-space will be linear. Thus, to investigate whether participant behaviour follows a power law, we fitted a linear model in log-log space (log-transformed dependent and independent variable) of run durations as a function of cumulative number of runs, for each participant separately. Fig.~\ref{fig:flowVperf} (panel A) shows this log-log performance data for each participant in each run. Blue dashed lines indicate the power-law LC. Distance of points from the line (residuals) indicate the deviation of each run from predicted learning: points above the line indicate longer duration/worse performance than predicted by the LC, and vice versa.

	% \label{fig:indiv_correlation_cogcar}
\end{figure*}

All participant-specific models had negative slopes, which indicates that with experience each participant learned to play better (obtained faster run times). The variation in intercepts reflects disparity in participants’ initial skill levels, and the variation in slopes the different learning rates. The individual intercepts and slopes of the fitted log-log models are presented in Table~\ref{tab:LCxFlow}. A grand model was also fitted for all participants, and cumulative number of runs (i.e. the learning effect) explained 39.6\% of variance in run durations.

To confirm that a power law model gives a good approximation of learning, we compared its model-fit criterion against the fit of an exponential curve model (see Supplementary Information for details). Both models had good fit, but the power law model was slightly better.

RQ1 can thus be answered: {\it the task was learned and the LC fit well to a power law model}. Given these positive answers, we may assume that the model provides a useful statistical estimate of performance expectation, i.e. how well the participants expect to perform can be estimated from the model.

\subsection*{RQ2: How is Flow related to performance?}

Participant-wise mean Flow and LC slope were related but not significantly correlated (Pearson {\it r} = 0.6, {\it p} = 0.08, N = 9). Since we have established that performance improves over sessions, we also used session number as a simple proxy of performance improvement. Fig.~\ref{fig:FlowVssn} shows the group-wise distribution of Flow scores plotted against sessions: clearly, there is no effect of session on group-wise median Flow (Pearson's {\it r} = -0.12, {\it p} = 0.77, N = 8).

\begin{figure*}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\nicewidth]{session_fss2}
	\caption{Violin plot representing participants' self-reported Flow in sessions 1-8 (Averages over five runs per session. The self-report items are given in Supplementary information, the scale was 1-7).}
	\label{fig:FlowVssn}
\end{figure*}

Next, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficient between median duration and median Flow, for each session (N = 9 for all). The relationship between duration and Flow was intermittently significant, but not with any particular trend. In the first session, the correlation was not significant ({\it r} = -.051, {\it p} = .90). In contrast, the Pearson correlation coefficients were significant in training session 3 ({\it r} = -.71, {\it p} = .03), session 4 ({\it r} = -.74, {\it p} = .02), and session 6 ({\it r} = -.71, {\it p} = .03). These results suggest that higher Flow was sometimes associated with lower run durations (i.e. better performance), but not systematically. If we group sessions by condition (introduction=1, practice=2--4, main test=5--8), we can visualize the evolution of performance against Flow more clearly than by plotting each session individually, see Fig.~\ref{fig:FlowVdurXssn}.

\begin{figure*}[!b]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\nicewidth]{session_flowDuration_v3}
  \caption{Duration and Flow over sessions grouped: 1, 2-4 (training), 5-8 (physiological measurements), N = 72.}
  \label{fig:FlowVdurXssn}
\end{figure*}

The relationships between global (over all responses) Flow and performance appear weak, but we also wish to examine local Flow for each run separately. The points in each subplot of Fig.~\ref{fig:flowVperf} (panel A) are coloured according to Flow self-reports made after each run, in a standardised range (i.e. original scores transformed to {\it z}-scores). The highest Flow scores are green, the lowest are red. Interestingly, this figure reveals at a glance that the points lie above and below the log-transformed power-law line in good agreement with the level of experienced Flow: worse performing runs (data-point above the line) tend to be more red (Flow scores below the participant-wise mean), and better performing runs tend to be more green (scores above the mean). In other words, it seems that whenever participants were performing {\it better than predicted by the power-law line}, they were experiencing more Flow; and {\it vice versa} when they were performing worse than predicted.

We evaluated whether this effect was robust and statistically significant. For each participant, we correlated their {\it deviation scores} (signed residuals from the power-law model) with their Flow scores, using a linear mixed model (see Methods). This model was statistically highly significant ($\beta$ = -8, {\it t} = -4.36, {\it p} $<$ .001) and the relationship is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:flowVperf} (panel B; Flow scores are standardized). The conditional pseudo-$R^2$ value for this model was .47, corresponding to a correlation of ~.68, so that the model explains $\sim$47\% of Flow score variability.

Thus, {\it high Flow scores are associated with better than predicted results} (i.e. with run durations below the predicted performance line), and {\it vice versa}. The strength of this association per participant follows from the strength of the correlation, and overall the model has large effect size.

As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:flowVperf} (panel B), the trend was clearly negative for 7 out of 9 participants, while for two participants, 3 and 7, the trend was similar but the relationship was weaker. Notably, these two participants also reported lower scores on perceived importance: mean scores for these participants were 2.03 and 2.22, whereas the overall mean was 3.77 (see Table ~\ref{tab:LCxFlow}). However, the group-wise interaction between perceived importance scores and deviation scores was not statistically significant.

RQ2 can thus be answered: Flow was not consistently and robustly related to improvement in task performance with the skill acquisition occurring over 2 h of practice. It was, however, consistently related to whether performance
was {\it better (or worse) than would predicted}, given the participant LC. Moreover, this effect seemed to be moderated by self-reported perceived importance of the driving task.

\subsection*{RQ3: is spontaneous eye blink rate is related to performance or Flow?}

sEBR showed a negative relationship to participant-wise LC slopes, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:EBRvLC}. The correlation is of moderate strength, though non-significant ({\it $\rho$} = -.66 , {\it p} = .05, N = 9). The LC slope of every participant was negative, which means we can say that the smaller the sEBR, the shallower the LC slope. Or, because slope and intercept are highly correlated, it is almost equivalent to say that smaller sEBR correlates with better initial performance.

Mean Flow scores are not related to sEBR, as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:EBRvLC} (Spearman correlation {\it $\rho$} = 0.13, {\it p} = 0.7, N = 9). However, examining the Flow scores in Fig.~\ref{fig:EBRvLC} turns up an interesting relationship: the residuals of the fitted linear model (i.e. vertical distance of each data-point from the line) are {\it strongly} related to mean Flow scores (Spearman correlation {\it $\rho$} = -.76 , {\it p} = .02, N = 9). In other words, participants' mean Flow scores are strongly correlated with their observed deviation from the modelled linear relationship between sEBR and task learning (LC slope). This correlation is not driven only by the non-significant correlation of Flow and LC (described above). Interaction analysis (see Methods) shows that when Flow mean is above 5.05, LC slope significantly predicts sEBR at {\it p} $<$ 0.001 (multiplicity corrected).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%     DISCUSSION    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Discussion}
% exploration of Flow and on-task learning (LC as opposed to pre- post)
We present a longitudinal experiment of Flow in a game-like high-speed steering task where task performance is easily parameterized, and its relation to Flow and sEBR analyzed. % game was fairly successful in eliciting Flow-like experiences (high baseline, score five out of seven)
To induce Flow, the game was designed to hold the balance between skill and challenge constant: the difficulty of the game continuaouly adapted to the skill level of the participant.

The results show the game was clearly Flow-inducing: `baseline' average Flow across sessions was reported as 5.1 (out of 7) on the FSS. %we do not see Flow increasing as you learn the game; it is not that when you play better you get more Flow
We further found that Flow was not associated with gaining experience and skill in the game -- our participants did not reliably report more Flow even as they learned, session by session, to complete the runs faster. These results support the theoretical position (e.g. as per \cite{Keller2012}) that Flow is elicited by the balance of skill and challenge; but show Flow is less sensitive to the absolute level (within a task) of skill or challenge.

% we are relating Flow to the learning mechanisms: the Flow reports across time are related via the LC (skill level)
% we do see that when you play better than expected, you report more Flow (but caution: direction on causation between Flow and performance unclear - does Flow lead to better performance or does better performance lead to higher (post hoc) self-reported Flow?)
Moreover, higher `local' Flow (runs with higher self-reported Flow) was associated with run durations shorter than expected by the power law LC model. In other words, while global average Flow remained relatively high and stable across all sessions, higher-than avearge or lower-than average Flow was associated with performance that was better or worse than expected (at the current level of skill).

In other words, learning to play the game did not itself increase Flow; rather, the game induced a fairly high level of `baseline' Flow, and local variability around this baseline was correlated with better or worse than statistically-expected performance. The relatively stable Flow baseline induced by the game could be construed as the reflecting the meeting of skill and challenge {\sf C1--3} by design.

It is a novel observation that local Flow relates to fluctuations of performance around the level expected from the learning curve. It is interesting because higher-than-expected performance in an individual run can plausibly indicate either: higher skill (e.g. better concentration), or: lower challenge (easier-to-negotiate random placement of obstacles). Both are deviations from the average skill-challenge balance, yet may be associated with higher Flow.

Why is this? One possiblity is that performance on some trials is enhanced by increased Flow during the trial - i.e. when participants ``get into Flow'' they perform better. Another possibility is that the skill-challenge balance in our task is slightly on the side of excessive challenge, and the `easier' trials bring the task closer to the optimum balance. Alternatively, participants may be more likely to report (after the fact) higher Flow when they have finished and seen the score on a more successful (hence, more rewarding) run. These alternatives cannot be readily discriminated in the present paradigm.


\subsection*{Learning, Flow, and models}
% Relation to previous Work on skill acquisition and Flow
How can our approach and the present results be helpful to understand the mechanisms generating the Flow experience?

% it's a good idea to look at Flow in relation to skill, across points in time...because we want to understand the mechanisms generating the experience (and the report of the experience)
Methodologically, this study follows a {\it time series} approach little used in Flow research, by looking at changes in Flow over time, with relatively highly frequent and non-independent repeated measurements. This contrasts with much prior work which treats Flow as a relatively stable property.

One contribution of our study is how, due to the novelty of the approach, it helps shed light on theoretical models of Flow. Psychological theory of Flow has dealt mainly with state and trait models \cite{Csikszentmihalyi1975}, and recent conceptual Flow research \cite{Moneta2012} has critically examined the classic octant/quadrant models \cite{Massimini1988}. Related work by Keller and Landhausser proposed an update \cite[pp-56]{Keller2012}: the Flow intensity model, which focuses on {\it perception} of challenge--skill balance and of task importance as governing factors for Flow. However, our study highlights the need to look not just at Flow experience, but at the (evolving) cognitive process that generates the experience, which is also related to {\it on-task} learning and skill acquisition.

To see this, consider our experimental performance data through the lens of either the Flow quadrant/octant model, or the Flow intensity model: they lead us to expect that as skills improve and challenges are consequently raised then Flow self-report should increase over time. Learning implies skill increase, which (by game design) implies challenge increase, which (by model design) together imply Flow increase.

Specifically, in the octant/quadrant model, if skills and challenges increase, the individual should feel further `north-east' of the median point where Flow bottoms out, and thus be more likely to report Flow and assign it greater intensity on a reporting scale. In the Flow intensity model, increased skills should increase both perceived fit of skills and task demands (because the task's deeper levels of challenge are uncovered precisely by learning the skills to meet them); {\it and} subjective value of the activity (because learning skills increases the learner's investment in the task). In summary, for such `state Flow' models' the reference frame is fixed, leading to the prediction of increased Flow with skill acquisition.
This is not supported by our data, and it is thus not straightforward to reason about the evolution of Flow, or learning and Flow, based on these models.

Regarding Flow as a dynamic process means it must be bounded, since any human dynamic process is bounded. Then, the natural homeostatic quality of a bounded dynamic process will tend to maintain Flow self-report at a level proportionate to the temporally local self-concept of skills and challenges. This does agree with our data, but there is less theoretical work available on which to base such a cognitive information-processing view of Flow.

Prior work has provided some (neuro)cognitive, information-processing models of Flow: including Marr's biobehavioural model \cite{Marr2001}; this lead author's model, which integrated elements from information theory to neurobiology \cite{Cowley2008}; or more recently, a descriptive model proposed by {\v{S}}imle{\v{s}}a and colleagues \cite{Simlesa2018} using a combustion-engine metaphor. However, these models were never empirically tested.

% Without aiming to propose a new model here, we can, based on our behavioural data, consider Flow and learning
One way to view Flow and learning is via task complexity. Flow has been proposed to be possible in {\it any} task, complex (e.g. car driving) or simple (e.g. dish washing) \cite{Csikszentmihalyi1999}, but has also been proposed to depend on perceived task importance and a sufficient level of challenge \cite{Keller2012}. One way to resolve these ideas is to consider that the individual can {\it introduce} complexity to their activity if they appear to have exhausted a task's potential to challenge them. Nakamura and Csikszentmihalyi \cite{Nakamura2002} suggest such an exploratory mechanism to explain how individuals maintain Flow in complex tasks: ``As people master challenges in an activity...to continue experiencing flow, they must identify and engage progressively more complex challenges.'' The corollary for simple tasks is that individuals {\it create} complexity, e.g. with self-defined goals \cite{Rauterberg1995}. For example, a similar state to Flow, called the Zone, has been reported for machine-gambling addicts whose passtime is in fact skill-free, but who nevertheless believe that they are skilled \cite{Schull2014}.

In other words, complex tasks have deep structure to be learned, requiring non-trivial skill acquisition for any duration of learning and thus a shallow LC (learning is slow). Importantly, the skill level does not quickly peak, such as with simpler tasks like washing the dishes, where Flow might be obtained but cannot strongly interact with learning (without self-created complexity). This distinction can help us reason about Flow processes, especially when we consider that the same task can appear at first simple and later complex, e.g. as our experiment game.

Considering separately the complex cognitive types of tasks, we define such as {\bf high performance cognition (HPC)}, and hypothesize that HPC arises from the balance of cognitive and task complexity, temporally extended by a controlled oscillation between exploration and exploitation. By so doing, we can in future attempt to clarify empirical observations by reference to a distinct cognitive theory of how Flow is generated.

\subsection*{Learning, Flow, and sEBR}
Our evidence suggests a clear, though non-significant, linear trend between sEBR and LCs (Fig.~\ref{fig:EBRvLC}): the larger the sEBR, the steeper the LC slope (or: the higher the LC intercept). The distribution of data-points with respect to this relationship (i.e. model residuals) also closely match the distribution of Flow mean scores. The latter fact means that the individual with lowest Flow, participant 4, also has the largest model residual. This provides reasonable grounds to re-examine the sEBR--LC relationship after removing \#4 as an outlier: indeed the sEBR correlation with LC greatly increases in strength (Pearson correlation {\it r} = -.83 , {\it p} = .01). It thus can be claimed that the sEBR--LC relationship is genuine and is moderated by Flow. This brings to the fore the issues of underlying mechanisms and causality. We cannot decide causality based on our data, but there is literature relevant to mechanisms, that can help identify future directions of inquiry.

Learning is influenced by the context-dependent disposition of the learner, which is to say learning is governed by psychological factors (motivation, prior experience), but also physio-/neurological factors. One relevant factor is the well-established relationship between attention and striatal dopamine levels \cite{Dreisbach2005}. The striatum plays a major role in decision making and reward/aversion processing, moderated by the level of tonic dopamine D2-receptors therein; dopamine imbalance can thus bias the entire learning process. This is illustrated for example in studies of `attentional blink' (AB) by Slagter and others \cite{Slagter2012,COLZATO2008}), which suggest a U-shaped function between tonic striatal dopamine and AB size (which relates to attention updating).

sEBR has been suggested as an externally-measureable index of striatal dopamine level (though see \cite{dang2017spontaneous}). Early work by Karson \cite{Karson1983} linked sEBR to striatal dopamine in humans and other primates. Taylor and colleagues \cite{Taylor1999} then localised to the caudate nucleus, whose normal function is implicated in classification learning \cite{Seger2005}; caudate nucleus volumetric asymmetry is implicated in inattention symptomatology \cite{Schrimsher2002}. Later work from Slagter \cite{Slagter2015} has shown that sEBRs may relate specifically to avoidance learning; others have linked dopamine levels and sEBR to perseverance, distractibility and cognitive control \cite{Muller2007,Dreisbach2005}. Finally, DeManzano {\it et al} \cite{DeManzano2013} have shown that  predisposition to experience Flow is positively correlated with striatal dopamine D2-receptor availability, specifically in caudate and putamen, and always stronger in right hemisphere than left.

Let us consider learning as a process whereby perception, cognition and action become attuned to task demands. In our game task, learning involves high-frequency decision making with respect to continuously updating stimuli of uniform kind (not unlike AB task, a continuous performance test designed to probe AB size \cite{Slagter2012}). In this view (proposed for focus, not to deny all other options), the sEBR--LC relationship could be interpreted as showing that higher sEBR supports learning. The underlying mechanism could be that higher dopamine levels permit more rapid attention updating and thus more fluid response to changing task demands. This can work despite Slagter {\it et al}'s \cite{Slagter2012} proposed U-shaped function: because our game-task constantly maintains a level of demand slightly greater than the participants' skill. Thus, in this context, higher sEBR tends to be better, possibly because the {\it requirement} for rapid attention updating grows with the learned task skill.

Flow was reduced for those participants who deviated (positively or negatively) from this relationship. % , which implies reduction of their subjective impression of absorption and challenge-skill balance (i.e. factors of FSS).
Lower Flow could be due to, e.g., misalignment of task demands and attentional updating rate, creating a more effortful experience. %Such attention difficulties could be partly due to excess or insufficient dopamine levels, and
So the observed moderation by Flow scores of the sEBR--LC relationship could be explained by neurophysiological difficulty of adjusting attention updating in response to changing task speeds. In other words, it may not be the case that an absolute level of striatal dopamine should predict learning, but rather a participant-relative level. If a participant's tonic dopamine is not at their ideal level for this task, they might nevertheless do well in the task, and yet find the experience more effortful and less fluid (than is suggested as Flow-like by wording of the FSS).


\subsection*{Limitations and Future Work}
Our study had a small convenience sample because (a) the recording paradigm was extensive (around eight hours of contact time), and (b) it was to some degree an exploratory study; both implying the need to constrain datasets to tractable sizes. Regardless of the justification, the sample size and method are limitations to be remedied in future work. Additionally, lacking experimental manipulations the study cannot make strong causal claims, which could be improved by recording separate conditions of the game task, e.g. with varied difficulty levels.

Trial-by-trial analysis is limited by the Flow self-report which only has one datapoint per run. It would be more powerful to analyse {\it inside} each trial. In our data, self-reported Flow is a point model of an entire run, for which the participant knows their score. Self-reported Flow is thus an after-the-fact report, and could be criticized for not capturing the in-the-moment {\it experience of Flow}, which might fluctuate greatly during a run. Analyzing the fluctuation of Flow-experience requires us to model individual actions and/or their outcomes, and sample Flow during performance. This is a difficult challenge, because paying attention to one's phenomenal state might easily disrupt the very processes sustaining that state, especially for Flow which is unreflective by definition. Future work should aim to model the conditions of Flow ({\sf C1--3}) in real-time, while simultaneously recording participant physiology, to uncover in greater detail the relationships involved. The existing dataset will be used for this purpose, in a pending report on the biosignals recorded with high temporal resolution, primarily electro-dermal activity.

To further explore the possible role of striatal dopamine, it would be interesting to experimentally manipulate the game to adjust the distance between obstacles, thus altering the attention-updating rate required to navigate without collisions (motor precision variation can be minimised by a suitably long training period). This manipulation could be varied in response to measurements of sEBR (which can be automated, e.g. by using electro-oculography \cite{toivanen2014}), to systematically investigate whether sEBR holds explanatory power with respect to individual variability in learning.


\subsection*{Conclusion}

% We report results that show how Flow assessment relates to the local reference frame provided by LCs; with evidence that the LC across sessions is predicted by participants' spontaneous blink rate.
We report results that self-reported Flow in a novel, challenging, and engaging high-speed steering task relates to trial-by-trial task performance relative to the learning curve: `better than expected' runs have higher Flow scores, and `worse than expected' runs have lower scores. The average level of self-reported Flow was high, as the game was specifically designed to meet the main preconditions of Flow, including balance of current skill and challenge. Perhaps surprisingly, Flow did not seem to change with global skill development or improvement in task performance.

We also report evidence that the learning curve (total play time about 2 h, distributed over two weeks) is predicted by the participants' spontaneous blink rate, potentially indicating a role for striatal dopamine in learning this visuomotor task. This relationship further appears to implicate global Flow, perhaps as a response to felt attentional effort.
